Lemonade
========
I was <b>extremely bored</b> today, and did not know what to do with my time, so I decided to <i>fork</i> my friend, Josh's project Lemonade and work on it. The original repository is <a href="https://github.com/trommel/lemonade">here</a>. Lemonade does its best to make you feel better by telling you to drink some lemonade,  ```<insidejoke>``` <b> At this point, feel free to go grab a cold or a warm beverage.</b> ```</insidejoke>```

Usage
-----

Setting up Lemonade on your Unix based computer is pretty simple!

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/it-handin/lemonade.git
$ cd lemonade/Executable/
$ rake
$ ruby lemonade.rb
```
(if you don't have rake, `gem install rake`)

Lemonade was originally coded by [josh](http://github.com/trommel), because he realized that a lot of his minor problems could be fixed with a glass of lemonade. Josh has very little knowledge in ruby so this is about all he can code. Cheers.

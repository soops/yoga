This would be a backup
==============

I have compiled all of the repositories that I made throughout the duration of the second semester of grade 10. Most of these projects were just simple and fun but I didn't want to remove them. I have put all of the repositories into one. Please refer to the `notes.markdown` in the folders for information on how to use them. Thanks!

Special thanks to Mr. Hu for being awesome enough for me to use my own laptop and teach my own course. It was fun. Have a great summer everybody!

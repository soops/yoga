Backup of Old Projects
==============

I have compiled all of the repositories that I made throughout the duration of the second semester of grade 10. Most of these projects were just simple and fun but I didn't want to remove them. I have put all of the repositories into one. Please refer to the `notes.markdown` in the folders for information on how to use them. Thanks!

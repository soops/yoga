Telesto: Font-Family
========
Hello everyone, I am working on a <b>Waiting List Website</b> for a font that I am currently designing. I received a lot of positive feedback when I posted screenshots of early verisons of the font on <b><a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a></b> and <b><a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a></b>. So I decided that I would make a website giving my fans the ability to subscribe to be notified when I release the font.

Changelog
------

```
Version 1.0
- Design based on http://html5up.net/tessellate
